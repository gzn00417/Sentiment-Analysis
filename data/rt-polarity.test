it's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless . 
an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . .

this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad .

this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow .

trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .

there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned .

watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .

 . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
a movie with a real anarchic flair . 
unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck . 
a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition . 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
at the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , " i guess i come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too . " congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 
de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience . 
although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too . 
'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
 the film is powerful , accessible and funny . you won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well . 
laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense . 
admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
 . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
 . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested . 
even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
 . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable . 
the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre . 
 . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !

by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better . 
give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
 . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
a slick , engrossing melodrama . 
a negligible british comedy . 
it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
a real snooze .

this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . 
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
exhilarating but blatantly biased . 
the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
the acting alone is worth the price of admission . 
if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for . 
it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 
this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
 . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom . 
while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't . 
putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 
the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
 " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
 . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 
majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
the power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s . 
an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 
the closest thing to the experience of space travel
most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
as vulgar as it is banal . 
as a science fiction movie , " minority report " astounds . 
people cinema at its finest . 
what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level . 
an alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary . 
 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
vera's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances . 
solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
unwieldy contraption . 
both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
the story really has no place to go since simone is not real—she can't provide any conflict . 
enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast . 
feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . 
sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 
a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . 
[shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate .

where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .

the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
catch it . . . if you can ! 
a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .

the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
adaptation is simply brilliant .

uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof .

she may not be real , but the laughs are . 
[howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting . 
a fun ride . 
you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork .
